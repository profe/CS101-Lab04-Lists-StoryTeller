# Lab 4 - Lists in Python + Story Teller

## Part 1:
Complete the `print_typewriter` function so that it will print one line of text with small pauses in between (see the printing of title above).

To complete it, you'll need to `import time` under the `# IMPORTS:` section. This will allow your program to use the `time.sleep(secs)` where `secs` is a placeholder for the number of seconds you'd like to pause the screen.

You'll also need to use the `flush` value when using `print`, similar to how we've used `sep`: [https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_print.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_print.asp)

## Part 2:
Complete the `print_story` function so that it prints all values in a list using print_typewriter (see the printing of 3 sentences above, between title and F I N).

## Hacker Challenge:
Create a `pause_story` function that will prompt the user "Press < ENTER > to continue..." and will wait until the user hits Enter (Hint: don't use `time.sleep` for this!)
